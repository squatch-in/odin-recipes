In this lession I will be regoing over some html basics while I relearn how to code. My goal by the end is to have a basic understanding again of html -which wont be too difficult- and be abke to do some simple thing for making a website.

Notes: I am going to be upfront with myself and say that I have been stuck in toutorial hell so this will be the last tutorial i will do then i will be off to do my own projects. My goal is to turn this into a hobby and possible a career. If this is going to be a career i would like to go to school to help with job potentallity.
