    <li>Add small holes into the top of your cake using a fork, and now wait 30 min to let cake cool.</li>
    <li>While we wait, mix the "tres leches"(whole milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk) on top of your cake and let the cake do the magic.</li>
    <li>As the milk is soaking into the cake we will make our cool whip. this is simply made by taking your heavy whipping cream adding some powder suger and mixing it with the electric mixer till you get soft peaks.</li>
